# Game Rules & How to Play

## Objective

Test and improve your memory by recalling different attributes of tiles displayed on a grid.

## Game Elements

Each tile in the game has four attributes:
1. **Position** - Where the tile is located on the grid
2. **Color** - The background color of the tile
3. **Symbol** - The emoji or shape displayed on the tile
4. **Number** - The numeric value shown on the tile

## How to Play

### 1. Starting the Game
- Click the "Start / Restart" button to begin
- A new game generates a grid of tiles with random attributes

### 2. Memorization Phase
- All tiles are displayed with their attributes visible
- Study the tiles carefully
- You have a limited time to memorize the information

### 3. Recall Phase
- Tiles are hidden or modified
- A question appears asking about a specific attribute
- Click the appropriate button to answer

### 4. Answering Questions
- **Position** - "Where was this tile located?"
- **Color** - "What color was this tile?"
- **Symbol** - "What symbol was on this tile?"
- **Number** - "What number was on this tile?"

### 5. Scoring
- ✅ Correct answer: +1 point
- ❌ Wrong answer: -1 point
- 🎯 Net score: Correct - Wrong
- Your score updates in real-time

## Game Modes

### Single Attribute Mode
Focus on memorizing one type of attribute:
- Position only
- Color only
- Symbol only
- Number only

### Mixed Mode (Coming Soon)
Combine multiple attributes for increased difficulty

## Tips for Better Memory

### Position Memory
- Create a mental map of the grid
- Use patterns or shapes to group positions
- Associate positions with landmarks (corners, center, edges)

### Color Memory
- Group similar colors together
- Create color stories or associations
- Focus on unique colors first

### Symbol Memory
- Create stories with the symbols
- Group similar symbols
- Use visual associations

### Number Memory
- Look for patterns (sequences, pairs)
- Group numbers by ranges
- Use mathematical relationships

## Difficulty Levels

### Easy
- Small grid (3x3 or 4x4)
- Longer memorization time
- Simple attribute combinations

### Medium
- Medium grid (5x5 or 6x6)
- Standard memorization time
- Mixed attributes

### Hard
- Large grid (7x7 or 8x8)
- Short memorization time
- Complex attribute combinations

## Scoring System

### Points
- Correct answer: +1
- Wrong answer: -1
- No penalty for timeout

### Streaks
- Consecutive correct answers may earn bonus points
- Streak counter resets on wrong answer

### Statistics
- Track your improvement over time
- Compare with other players
- View daily averages

## Strategy Guide

### Before the Game
- Get comfortable and minimize distractions
- Decide on your memorization strategy
- Stay relaxed but focused

### During Memorization
- Scan the entire grid first
- Focus on unique or distinctive tiles
- Create mental associations
- Use chunking (group information)

### During Recall
- Trust your first instinct
- Use elimination if unsure
- Stay calm under pressure

### Common Techniques

#### The Story Method
Create a story that connects the tiles:
"The red star in the corner was next to the blue circle with number 7..."

#### The Journey Method
Imagine a path through the grid:
"Starting at top-left, I saw a green square, then moved right to a yellow triangle..."

#### The Association Method
Link attributes to familiar things:
"Red like fire, star like Hollywood, 7 like lucky number..."

## Memory Science

This game is based on cognitive psychology principles:
- **Chunking** - Grouping information for easier recall
- **Visualization** - Creating mental images
- **Association** - Linking new information to existing knowledge
- **Spaced Repetition** - Practicing at increasing intervals

Regular practice can improve:
- Working memory capacity
- Visual-spatial skills
- Attention to detail
- Cognitive processing speed
